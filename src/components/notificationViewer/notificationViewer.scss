// NOTE: If this is an ezModal component our normal css targeting will not work.
// The modals are detachable, so they do not exist within the component element
// in the DOM. You need to set this top level selector to a class name (ideally
// by just simply converting the component name to a class name) and pass that
// class name into ezModal's em-class-name binding.
